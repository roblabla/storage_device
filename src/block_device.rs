//! Common block device trait.
//!
//! A block device represents a storage device whose content can only be
//! accessed through blocks of a certain size and alignment. For instance, a
//! common hard drive can only be accessed through 512-bytes blocks.

    ///
    /// There are several invariants Block must respect in order to make
    /// BlockDevice safe to use:
    ///
    /// 1. Block MUST have no padding bytes. In other words, the size
    ///    of all its component MUST be equal to its size_of::<Self>.
    ///
    ///    This comes as an additional invariant to all the other Plain
    ///    requires, and is necessary to be able to cast a Block to an u8 array,
    ///    which is internally done by the StorageDevice implementation for
    ///    a BlockDevice.
    /// 2. Its Deref implementation MUST deref to its internal byte array.
    // TODO: Add a trait to encode Block's invariants
    // BODY: Currently, Block's invariants aren't properly encoded in the type
    // BODY: system. They are merely documented in BlockDevice's documentation.
    // BODY: This is, obviously, absolutely terrible. We need to come up with
    // BODY: the correct set of functions and rules necessary for a proper
    // BODY: Block implementation that makes this whole crate safe to use.
